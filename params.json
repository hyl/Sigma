{"name":"Sigma","tagline":"Private web chat using Node.js and WebSocket","body":"### Welcome to Sigma.\r\nSigma is the easiest way to create a multi-user, one-on-one chat server using Node.js and WebSocket. Think Omegle, but less horny-teenagery and more open-sourcey. Sigma can be run with the included front end, or just a backend so that you are free to design your own UI. Sigma is super easy to install, with only one dependency:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install\r\n$ node server.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may want to edit `server.js` before running it so that you can change the port it runs on.\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\nhttp://ovalbit.github.io/sigma/demo/\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nSigma was authored by Benedict Lewis. So far, no one else has contributed.\r\n\r\n### Found a bug?\r\nSorry about that. Just open a new issue, or feel free to fork Sigma, fix it, and then submit a pull request and I will get it integrated as soon as possible (promise!).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble? Contact benedict@ovalbit.com and I'll see what I can do.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
