{"name":"Sigma","tagline":"Private web chat using Node.js and WebSocket","body":"### Welcome to Sigma.\r\nSigma is the easiest way to create a multi-user, one-on-one chat server using Node.js and WebSocket. Think Omegle, but less horny-teenagery and more open-sourcey. Sigma can be run with the included front end, or just a backend so that you are free to design your own UI. The included UI is based on Bootstrap.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install crypto\r\n$ npm install cli-color\r\n$ npm install express\r\n$ npm install websocket\r\n$ node server.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may want to edit `server.js` before running it so that you can change the port it runs on.\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\nhttp://109.74.195.222/\r\n\r\n### Security\r\nWhen a user connects they are sent a message containing their ID, and an MD5 hash of a server-side salt, plus their ID:\r\n>{\"type\": \"id\", \"id\": 1, \"hash\": \"4b1ffd3c0c44a77c9121ffadcecedda5\"}\r\n\r\nWhen they are assigned a partner, they are sent their partners ID and hash:\r\n>{\"type\": \"partner\", \"id\": 2, \"hash\": \"a3b170f94f79a0110ee96098cb0bb8dc\", ...}\r\n\r\nEvery request they make must contain their ID and hash, and if it interacts with their partner, their partners ID and hash. When requests are received the hash is regenerated and checked. If the two hashes do not match then the request is denied. This prevents a user just changing their ID and interacting with other users.\r\n\r\n####Vulnerabilities\r\nWhile the system prevents a user chatting with someone they haven't spoken to, in theory if a user was to chat with someone they could make a note of the persons ID and hash, and then set the local partner variable to that and send messages with no problem (however the partner wouldn't be able to reply).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nSigma was authored by Benedict Lewis. So far, no one else has contributed.\r\n\r\n### Found a bug?\r\nSorry about that. Just open a new issue, or feel free to fork Sigma, fix it, and then submit a pull request and I will get it integrated as soon as possible (promise!).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble? Contact benedict@ovalbit.com and I'll see what I can do.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
